## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Tips

### **Before the Demo**
1. **Test everything**: Make sure all features work
2. **Prepare examples**: Have specific properties and searches ready
3. **Check internet**: Ensure stable connection for API calls
4. **Have backup**: Screenshots in case of technical issues

### **During the Demo**
1. **Start with overview**: Give context before diving into code
2. **Show user journey**: Walk through typical user interactions
3. **Explain decisions**: Why certain technologies were chosen
4. **Highlight challenges**: Show how problems were solved
5. **Keep it engaging**: Ask questions and encourage interaction

### **Technical Points to Emphasize**
1. **TypeScript benefits**: Type safety and better development experience
2. **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
3. **Error handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback
4. **Performance**: Optimized loading and caching strategies
5. **Scalability**: Modular architecture for future enhancements

### **Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: Why did you choose React over other frameworks?**
A: "React provides excellent component reusability, strong ecosystem, and great TypeScript support. The virtual DOM ensures good performance, and the large community provides extensive resources."

**Q: How does the fallback system work?**
A: "The PropertyService first tries to fetch data from the backend API. If that fails, it gracefully falls back to local mock data, ensuring the app always works even if the API is down."

**Q: How is the responsive design implemented?**
A: "Using Tailwind CSS utility classes with responsive breakpoints. The layout automatically adapts from mobile (single column) to desktop (multi-column grid) based on screen size."

**Q: What about performance optimizations?**
A: "We use Vite for fast builds, image lazy loading, code splitting, and browser caching. The app also includes skeleton loading states for better perceived performance."

**Q: How would you scale this application?**
A: "The modular architecture makes it easy to add features. We could implement state management with Redux, add a real database, implement user authentication, and add more advanced search features."
